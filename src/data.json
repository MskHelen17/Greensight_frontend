Dan heeft het Infrabedrijf van de politie in Odijk, Driebergen en/of Rotterdam de ideale functie voor jou!Eén van de pijlers van goed en efficiënt politiewerk is de ICT dienstverlening. Dat geldt voor alle onderdelen van de politie. Of het nu gaat over handhaving, opsporing of noodhulp, de informatievoorziening speelt hierin een cruciale rol. Om ervoor te zorgen dat deze informatie up-to-date, to-the-point en goed beveiligd is, beschikt de nationale politie over een omvangrijke ICT-organisatie, met getalenteerde, professionele en zeer gemotiveerde medewerkers. Binnen het Infrabedrijf zijn we op zoek naar lead engineers die leiding willen geven aan een technisch team. Dat kan op het gebied van platformen of endpoints zijn. Weet je technisch waar het over gaat, ben je in staat de samenwerking te organiseren en uit te dragen, is het je ambitie om gezamenlijk het beste uit het team naar boven te halen en wil jij de beste ICT-dienstverlening leveren aan onze afnemers dan zijn we op zoek naar jou!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLocatie(s):Driebergen-Rijsenburg, Odijk, Rotterdam\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOrganisatieonderdeel:Politiedienstencentrum\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eVakgebied(en):ICT\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eNiveau:HBO\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWat ga je doen?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAls lead engineer zorg je voor een coachende aansturing en planning van de technisch beheerders en ontwikkelaars binnen het cluster. Samen met je team ben je verantwoordelijk voor het oplossen van de incidenten, het preventieve en correctieve beheer en release en Life Cycle Management van de producten en diensten die door jouw team geleverd en ondersteund worden. Je behoudt het overzicht, bewaakt de samenhang over de verschillende disciplines binnen en buiten de productlijn. Je coördineert de inzet bij changes, incidenten en problemen en levert input aan de productlijnmanager voor productplannen en roadmaps. Buiten werktijd ben je op basis van roulatie basis beschikbaar voor standby diensten (zoals bij escalaties en changes). Daarnaast ben jij diegene die zorgt voor trendanalyses en deze omzet in verbeterinitiatieven.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWaar ga je werken?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAls lead engineer zorg je voor de aansturing en inzet van de beheerders en ontwikkelaars in één van de technische teams van het Infrabedrijf. Omdat het Infrabedrijf veel verschillende disciplines omvat is het onderverdeeld in clusters en daarna in technische teams. Voor de volgende teams zijn we nog op zoek naar een doortastende lead engineer:\nHet team Applicatie packaging van Cluster Endpoints zorgt ervoor dat applicaties op uniforme wijze worden aangeboden op zowel de laptops en fat clients, maar ook op de verschillende Citrix omgevingen. Ook zorgen we ervoor dat updates snel doorgevoerd kunnen worden en dat Life Cycle Management in orde is. Technieken die we gebruiken zijn AppV, RES/Ivanti en Citrix.\nHet team Enterprise Mobility is ook onderdeel van het Cluster Endpoints en zorgt ervoor dat mobiele oplossingen meer en meer geïntegreerd kunnen worden in het politiewerk. Denk aan het ontsluiten van verschillende smartphones en tablets, maar ook het beheren, exploiteren en ondersteunen van mobiele werkplekken en de bijbehorende applicaties en infrastructuren. Technieken die we gebruiken zijn XenMobile, Samsung Knox, Google/Android en Apple DEP\nHet team Microsoft server is onderdeel van het cluster Platformen. We zijn aanwezig op twee locaties, nl. Rotterdam en Driebergen, maar we werken als een virtueel team. Als team zorgen we voor het beheer van de Microsoft Server dienstverlening, het OS, de security en Hardening. Daarnaast zijn we verantwoordelijk voor de Active directory en exchange en SQL waar de politie applicaties gebruik van maken.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2\u003eWie ben jij?\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWij zoeken iemand die zijn/haar enthousiasme, kennis, doelgerichtheid en leiderschap wil inzetten om samen met het team optimale prestaties neer te zetten en verbinding te zoeken binnen en buiten het cluster. Je bent een echte teamspeler, kunt goed motiveren en enthousiasmeren, inhoudelijke discussies voeren, luisteren en samenvatten. Je neemt beslissingen die respectvol zijn naar iedereen. Tijdens escalaties weet je het overzicht te behouden, prioriteiten te stellen en blijf je helder communiceren. We kunnen je veel kennis bijbrengen maar je eigen stijl en houding breng je zelf mee. We zijn op zoek naar een zelfstandige en stevige persoonlijkheid, die niet afwacht maar steeds de stap vooruit zet.

That philosophy has been applied in more than 132 countries since NDI’s founding. NDI has been a pioneer in the use of technology as an integral component of democratic development.

Our core software product, Cognite Data Fusion (CDF), powers companies with contextualized OT/IT data to develop and scale solutions that increase safety, sustainability, efficiency, and drive revenue.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout the Database Reliability Engineering Team\nCognite’s Cognite Data Fusion contextualizes operational data at scale, enabling asset-intensive industries to make data-driven decisions. Our platform is built on many different technologies, each good at solving different problems. Some of these are absolutely fundamental, and the Database Reliability Engineering team will be responsible for the continuous well-being of our portfolio of FoundationDB, PostgreSQL, Elasticsearch and Kafka clusters, some of which we expect to have thousands of in the years to come – in both public and private clouds, through managed services and on self-managed Kubernetes clusters.\nEven when using mature as-a-Service offerings and Kubernetes operators, there are many things that can and will go wrong. Herding clusters that need upgrading, upscaling, cost-trimming, and recovery etc., while continuously serving heavy workloads with tight SLOs requires solid reliability engineering.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAbout our Tech stack:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eWe work with open source technologies that need to run in multiple cloud environments – both public clouds (like Google Cloud Platform and Azure) and in private clouds with customer provided Kubernetes.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eManaged Kubernetes (GKE, AKS, Openshift) forms the base that we build our products on top of. To prove the market we initially built on PaaS offerings to store state, such as Google Bigtable, Spanner and Pubsub. We replicate data to different storage systems to be able to answer different types of queries. As we diversify the platforms our offering runs on, we are migrating to a self-run Foundation DB based scale-out data store for managing time series data.  PostgreSQL and Elasticsearch are also important examples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eOur backend developer teams work with Java, Scala, Python, and Rust. CI/CD is handled by a combination of Github, Jenkins, and Spinnaker to test and deploy code to production.
